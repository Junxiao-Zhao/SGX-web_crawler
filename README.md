## Notes
- For some earliest dates, "TC_structure.dat" has the name "TickData_structure.dat" or "ATT\*"; It will be saved to "TC_structure-\*.dat"
- For some earliest date, "WEBPXTICK_DT-\*.zip" has the name "\*\_web.tic", and "TC_\*.txt" has the name "\*\_web.atic1". These two will be saved to "WEBPXTICK_DT-\*.tic" and "TC_\*.atic1"
- For some earliest date, "WEBPXTICK_DT-\*.zip" has the name "WEBPXTICK_DT-\*.gz" and will be saved as "WEBPXTICK_DT-\*.gz"
- Since the data on the website always has one trade date delay, so download today's data will always fail; recommend to use download last trade date instead
